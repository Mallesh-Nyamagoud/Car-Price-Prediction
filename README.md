# Car-Price-Prediction
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the selling price of a car based on its features. By analyzing historical data.
### Objective

* The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the selling price of a car based on its features. By analyzing historical data, the model aims to provide insights into the factors influencing car prices and assist sellers or buyers in making data-driven decisions.

### Problem Statement

* Determining the fair price of a used car is challenging due to numerous influencing factors.

* Sellers struggle to set competitive yet realistic prices.

* Buyers often find it difficult to evaluate if a car is priced fairly.

* Factors such as mileage, engine size, fuel type, and ownership history impact pricing.

* A predictive model is needed to estimate car prices accurately and simplify decision-making.

### Dataset

* __File Name:__ Car details v3.csv

* __Attributes:__ Various car features including brand, year, fuel type, transmission, mileage, engine size, and selling price.

* __Target Variable:__ Selling Price

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* __Performed the following preprocessing steps:__

* Handling Missing Values: Imputed or removed missing data.

* Handling Duplicate Values: Checked and removed duplicate records.

* Feature Scaling: Applied standardization or normalization.

* Encoding Categorical Variables: Converted categorical data into numerical format.

* Feature Engineering: Created new features to improve model performance.

### Results & Insights

* Identified key factors affecting car prices.

* Compared multiple regression models to find the best-performing one.

* Provided an interpretable and data-driven approach to price prediction.

### Conclusion

* This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting car prices. By using regression techniques and thorough data preprocessing, we can achieve a reliable pricing model that benefits both buyers and sellers.
